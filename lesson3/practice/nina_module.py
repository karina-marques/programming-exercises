# Write the functions you will use in the exercises here
# In the single exercises write just the test cases
# That will use the functions defined in this module.

# Write a function named 'celsius_to_fahrenheit' that takes as input a temperature in C 
# and outputs the temperature converted into Fahrenheit
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature_in_celsius):
    return 32+temperature_in_celsius*180/100

# Write a function named 'fahrenheit_to_celsius' that takes as input a temperature in F and outputs the temperature converted it into C
# TODO

# Write a function named 'celsius_to_kelvin' that takes as input a temperature in C and outputs the temperature converted it into Kelvin
# TODO

# Write a function named 'fahrenheit_to_kelvin' that takes as input a temperature in F and outputs the temperature converted it into Kelvin
# Tip: reuse the previous functions.
# TODO

# Write a function named 'maximum' that takes as input two numbers and returns the maximum
# TODO

# Write a function named 'maximum3' that takes as input three numbers and returns the maximum
# Tip: reuse the function 'maximum' previously defined
# TODO

# Write a function named 'is_dividible' that takes as input two integer numbers 'a' and 'b' and returns True if a is dividible by b and False otherwise.
# TODO

# Write a function named 'is_even' that takes as input an integer number and returns True if the number is Even and False otherwise
# Tip: reuse the function 'is_dividible'
