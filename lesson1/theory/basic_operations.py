# Basic operations in python

# Assignation: assign a value to a variable
# You can think of a variable as a box, it holds the value you put inside of it
# Python does not need to declare the type of a variable in advance

x = 5 # x contains 5 after this instruction
x = "Marco" # x contains the string "Marco" after this instruction

# Operations on numbers
# All basic operations among numbers can be performed in python

x = 5 * 4 # Multiplies 5 by 4 and stores the result in x
x = x / 20 # Divides x by 20 and stores the result in x
y = x + x # Adds x by x and stores the result in x
y = y - 50 # Subtracts y by 50 and stores the result in y

# When performing the division, it is important to note
# the difference between the / operator and the // operator
# / performs the normal division
# // performs the integer division

x = 20 / 6 # result is 3.3333333333333335
x = 20 // 6 # result is 3

# Assignation and operations can be combined
# For example

x = x + 10 # can be written as x += 10
x = x - 10 # can be written as x -= 10
x = x * 10 # can be written as x *= 10
x = x / 10 # can be written as x /= 10
x = x // 10 # can be written as x //= 10
